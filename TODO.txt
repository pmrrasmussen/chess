add possibility to pick promoted piece: 
- when the window with options is shown, it should not be possible to make any moves

write an AI that makes random moves

be able to setup a board manually - nice to have

undo a move(s) - nice to have

make UI nicer. example: captured pieces should be smaller and in 2/3 rows. 45px is spread across code base (fx: capturedPieces has it or PieceUI).
Try to change the size of a piece and see stuff breaking

Now we have 2 places where we have the state of the board:
a) UI
b) Game class (it has a board property)
those 2 has to be in sync

I kind of like previous approach where we had the state in UI (godot nodes) and we would extract the important information from that state 
and pass it to "Engine" which would make a decision on possible moves and so on.
I think I went away from it because I needed lastMove. But lastMove could be passed in, together with the state of the board.

3 things can happen to a piece:
- moved (Position updated)
- captured (Piece deleted)
- promoted (Position and Texture updated)
